This is an automated test suite using Cypress for testing the profile creation and validation functionality on the Kwentara platform. The test suite is designed using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for maintainability and readability. Additionally, it leverages Gherkin feature files to describe test scenarios in a clear, human-readable format, promoting a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach.
